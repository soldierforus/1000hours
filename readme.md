This is a time logger written in node with a Command Line Interface.  I wrote it keep track and achieve my own personal goal of 1000 hours of coding.  

In the book <i>Outliers</i>, author Malcolm Gladwell says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. Since that would take 416 days and 16 hours of straight practice, my initial goal is that of 1000 hours.

You can use the terminal commands: 'start', 'stop', 'reset', and 'showtime'

"node 1000.js start" will begin the timer
"node 1000.js stop" will stop the timer
"node 1000.js reset" will reset the save logs
"node 1000.js showtime" will show your current progress in HH:mm:ss

This is just a Minimum Viable Product so feel free to contribute.  There is a lot more features I would like to add (eg setting goals, having alarms when goals are met, countdown/distance from goals, etc)
