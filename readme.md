This is a time logger written in node with a Command Line Interface.  I wrote it keep track and achieve my own personal goal of 1000 hours of coding.  

In the book <i>Outliers</i>, author Malcolm Gladwell says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. Since that would take 416 days and 16 hours of straight practice, my initial goal is that of 1000 hours.

You can use the terminal commands: 'start', 'stop', 'reset', and 'showtime'

"node 1000.js start" will begin the timer<br>
"node 1000.js stop" will stop the timer<br>
"node 1000.js reset" will reset the save logs<br>
"node 1000.js showtime" will show your current progress in HH:mm:ss<br>

This is just a Minimum Viable Product so feel free to contribute.  There is a lot more features I would like to add:

 Setting goals<br>
 Alarms when goals are met<br>
 Countdown/distance from goals<br>
 Show Time logged by Day/Week/Month/Year<br>
 etc<br>

 Unfortunately have to stop with an MVP. I have to keep coding other projects to learn new things and to achieve my goal of <b>#1000HoursOfCoding</b>

 Good luck in achieving whatever goal you have, I hope this Time logger helps you to achieve it.
